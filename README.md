this is also the first place to test the visualisations packages that I've been downloading and figuring out their strengths and how to use in a performance and/or creative process


### Modes
* Playback of static files
* Live Visualisation of Static File



# RemixVideo mixVibes
it breaks me that this software is buggy
Will Render in RealTime from the VST Screen Out
While it will render to a video file it will also lose Framerate and as such use with Caution.
* Also the rendered video and audio may not be in sync
* Which worse means that whether it is in sync needs to be tested for and it may work differently for different samples

What is important to remember is that samples can be sources/recorded and then downloaded into the RemixVideo and Reaper used as a Sequencer and live mixer for these samples....therefore while it would be great to attach live audio to RemixVideo Pads and it would be wonderful if the RemixVideo Render worked ..... what's important to remember is that it is beautiful when it works well and it does have a definate use case and appreas to stable when used as in Reaper DAW to run sequences of samples with live effects
Also it can be used as a Standalone Sequencer

## Capture
I tried Snagit Screen capture and it didn't work although at least the video was in sync with the audio, however the video had too many dropped frames.

Now it looks like that Sprout could be an option or else it just comes down to the fact that this machines graphics processing capabilites are insufficent and that the software is ok and it's a hardware issues that requires an upgrade to resolve

## Best (so far) Render Method
### best way is sync ends of track!
click record in RemixVideo VST and then playback MIDI Project....had to reduce to 480p otherwise dropped frames....audio appears out of sync with the rendered file

Dropped frames so reduced the resolution/quality to 480p

still dropped frames at the start

Export is audio/video is out of sync

This means that the design of the DAW project needs to allow for MIDI Signals at the start to allow for syncing the video back to the project




# Magic Visuals
* Magic can take multiple different types of input
    - Audio Input
    - Routed Reaper/Spotify Playback
    - MIDI Files as recorded
    - Audio files already recorded
* Magic does not have the VST Capabilities
But it does render well so the playlist functionaility could be synced with Reaper Scaffolding and then the videos imported into Reaper




# The Case for GSLD Shaders



# Render Test
What performance of Render will I get from RemixVideo in Reaper
### So the workflow would be 
* Standalone - work out visuals
* Reaper - Scaffolding of Track
* 
## Reaper Settings for Video Render
